    <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>Our mission is to help give pets a forever home. We want to make sure every pet has a chance to have a long happy life with someone that loves them. We provide resources on adopting a pet and how much it costs. Owning a pet is not cheap. You should be prepared to spend money on them. Our website gives an estimate for how much they cost a year. A pet is a living creature that depends on you for survival. Our goal is to make sure you are ready for that commitment. Give your pet the life it deserves.</p>

	<h3>Values</h3>
      <p>We value the lives of pets. We do not believe in buying pets from breeders when there are so many homeless animals in the shelter. Roughly <a href = "https://www.aspca.org/helping-people-pets/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics">1.5 million shelter animals</a> are put down each year. Encouraging people to adopt rather than buy a pet can help decrease that number. Every animal's life has value. We ask you to join our cause. Adopt your furry friend and stay away from breeders. Help us save shelter animals.</p><br><br>
