  <h2>Adopting A Pet</h2>

   <section>
    <h3>Are you ready for a pet?</h3>
      <p>Animals are a huge responsibility. Before buying a pet, you need to make sure you have the time and money. You are their entire life. We want to make sure you can give them the best possible life. Before adopting, make sure you have all of the resources you need. Get them a bed, some toys, food, and treats. Set up an area for them so they feel safe. They may not warm up to you and your family right away. Slowly introduce your pets if you have them. Give them time to adjust to their new forever home.</p><br>

	<h3>Why it is better to adopt</h3>
      <p>There are many animals in shelters waiting for homes. Not every shelter is a no kill shelter. Every animal deserves a chance at a good life. Adopting is a lot cheaper than buying from a breeder. It also helps save the animals that are stuck in the shelter. It should not matter that an animal is a purebred. You should focus on finding the perfect animal companion. There are many shelters with hundreds of animals waiting for a home. You may not find the right pet for you right away, but when you do you will be happy you adopted them.</p><br>

	<h3>Why you should avoid breeders</h3>
      <p>Breeders usually only care about the money. They tend to not care about the health of animals. They overbreed them. It can be very harmful to the females. Nursing a litter is a lot of work. They need time to rest. They care about making purebreds, which can lead to inbreeding. This can cause serious health problems. They do not consider the well-being of the animal. They want to constantly breed so they earn more money. There is already enough animals in the world that need homes.</p><br>
